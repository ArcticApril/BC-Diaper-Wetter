To download, [either copy the text in this file to a bookmark](https://github.com/mrbakucamp/BC-Diaper-Wetter/edit/main/bcdw-loader-bookmark) or [add this](https://mrbakucamp.github.io/BC-Diaper-Wetter/bcdw-loader-tampermonkey.js) as a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script.
Once you have done that, wear either a poofy or bulky diaper (either the panties or chastity version, or both if you want more potential uses!) and type `->diaper start` in chat. Once you're done using it, type `->diaper stop` to become contienent again.

## Aditional usage tips
`->diaper start` has several arguments! Here they are listed!
- `wetchance` controls how often you will wet. Takes a value between 0 and 1 (higher is more often). Default is 0.5
- `messchance` is similar, but for messing. Make sure this is lower than `wetchance`. Default is 0.3
- `desperation` sets your initial "desperation" level, which is normally controlled by having a milk bottle used on you. Range is between 0 and 3, default is 0.
- `regression` sets your initial "regression" level, which is normally controlled by wearing Nuersery Milk for an extended period of time. Range is between 0 and 3, default is 0.
- `wetpanties`/`messpanties`/`wetchastity`/`messchastity` each control how much both diapers are used. Ranges are from 0 to 2, defaults are all 0.
